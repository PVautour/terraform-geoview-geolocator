    """
    Main function. When called, performs specific actions in order to
          extract, adapt, and return REST data from several specific services.

    Those actions are:
    - Initialize. Defines variables and services, reads schemas and validates
                 parameters
    - Query assembling. Based on the schema for each required service, a valid
                        url is assembled before calling the REST service
    - Service output. the response is adapted to the expected structure
    - Validation. The resulting data is validated against an output schema to
                  be 'conformed' before be handed to the front-end

    Params:
      event: Contiens the query parameters
      context: Not required for this function

    Returns: Standarized, validated data from REST services related to
             geolocation to be handed to the front-end
